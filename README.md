# VBA-Stock Market Analysis

This project loaded market data Excel worksheets to determine:

* Ticker symbol
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.
* Added functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
* Made the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
* Used conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

Results were screenshot in lieu of worksheet uploads.
